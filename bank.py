# prompt the user to enter two money amounts in cent and output the sum of these two figures in euros and cents


amount1 = input("Enter amount 1 in cent ")
amount2 = input("Enter amount 2 in cent ")
x = amount1
y = amount2

answer = (x+y)

print (answer)

# output currently shows amount 1 and amount 2 beside each other instead of their sum e.g if amount 1 is 26 and amount 2 is 54, output shows 2654 instead of 80
# script works fine if amounts are not variables so issue is likely because variables aren't implemented properly
