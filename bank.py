# prompt the user to enter two money amounts in cent and output the sum of these two figures in euros and cents

amount_1 = int(input("Enter amount 1 in cent "))
amount_2 = int(input("Enter amount 2 in cent "))
total = int((amount_1+amount_2))

# need to show total to two decimal places as this is the usual convention for writing money figures

result_as_decimal = int(float(f'{total:.2f}'))

# need to divide result_as_decimal by 100 to convert from cents to euros

answer_in_euro = result_as_decimal/100.00

print (f"The total is â‚¬{answer_in_euro}")
